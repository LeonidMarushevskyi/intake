= The Casebook Intake Accelerator

== Section 1. Introduction to the Casebook Intake Accelerator

The Casebook Accelerator Toolkit is a collection of Accelerators that are designed to assist agile teams in iteratively developing child welfare products across the country.  Each Accelerator has a publicly accessible repo in GitHub providing tools, components and/or assets to jumpstart an agile development process for child welfare.  

The Intake Accelerator GitHub repository will enable agile development teams to pull the source code, deploy it and build upon it for child welfare purposes.  

The Intake Accelerator is designed to enable the iterative, agile development of a Child Welfare Intake application.
